## Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving education landscape, providing exceptional customer support has become a critical challenge for educational companies. Traditional support methods often struggle to keep pace with growing student needs, increasing support costs, and the demand for instant, personalized assistance. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into customer support is revolutionizing how education companies interact with and support their students, leading to improved outcomes and reduced operational costs.
